        " 1- What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "\n",
        "* RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It's a set of principles and constraints that dictate how web services communicate with each othe\n",
        "\n",
        "2-  Explain the concept of API specification?\n",
        "* An API specification, also known as API documentation or API contract, is a detailed description of an API's functionality. It serves as a blueprint or a guide for both developers who want to use the API (client-side) and developers who are building or maintaining the API (server-side).\n",
        "\n",
        "3- What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "* Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used to build web apps and APIs. It's popular because it's simple, flexible, and easy to learn. Flask gives full control to developers, supports RESTful routing, and has many useful extensions. It's ideal for building small to medium APIs quickly and is great for prototyping\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Why Flask is Popular for Building APIs:**\n",
        "* Flask provides only the core tools needed to get started, without unnecessary complexity. This makes it easy to build small to medium-sized APIs quickly.\n",
        "* Developers have full control over architecture and components. You can choose your own libraries for things like database access, authentication, etc.\n",
        "* Flask has a very gentle learning curve, especially for those who are already familiar with Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "4- What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "* Routing in Flask is the process of mapping URLs to specific functions in your code. When a user visits a URL, Flask uses routing to decide which function should handle the request and what response to send back.\n",
        "\n",
        "5- How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "* **To create a Flask app:**\n",

        "* Example: Create a new user\n",
        "\n",
        "* PUT – Updates existing data (replaces entire resource)\n",
        "* Example: Update all details of a user\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "15- What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        "* The jsonify() function in Flask is used to convert Python data (like dictionaries or lists) into JSON format, which is the standard format for API responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16- Explain Flask’s url_for() function?\n",
        "* The url_for() function in Flask is used to dynamically build URLs for your routes using the function names, instead of hardcoding the URLs.\n",
        "* **Purpose:**\n",
        " * Makes your app more flexible and maintainable\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "19-  What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "* HTTP status codes are 3-digit numbers returned by a server to indicate the result of a client’s request.\n",
